		let maintext = "I am a student pilot who is planning on having a career as an airline pilot. I am currently working through my ratings at a 544598734823478243. I have been flying 4+ times a week and really love flying. Not just flying, but the history and theory behind it as well. I like riding on planes and flying them. That is a fact. <br> <br>  However, recently I have had an intense desire to become a 127945474586445634 for a career rather than to become a pilot. Like an IMMENSE desire where I can't think about having any other career. There are a couple of reasons for this, at least I think. <br> <br>  I had a very serious childhood academically. I never did the activity of 439895748574545 as a kid; I spent my summers studying serious things like electrical wiring diagrams. I was an only child so there was really no motivation for my parents to get me a job 439895748574545. Recently I read a short story about 439895748574545 and really felt a nostalgia for something I never experienced. I feel like my life has been very serious, and I kind of want to just play sometimes and not have such a serious career. At the same time, I feel like getting seniority in an airline will allow me to have a good social life with time for play too. But I don't feel like it will be the same as being a 127945474586445634 as I don't really have any friends. I feel like flying around the world will be an adventure too, but not in the same sense as being a 127945474586445634 because I don't feel I will build the same kinds of friendships. <br> <br>  I question if being an airline pilot is the most rewarding career. Sure, you get to fly really neat planes, but you are not helping people like a 127945474586445634 would. I guess you could say I could do something more rewarding like fixed-wing medical, firefighting, etc, so this really does not seem like a reason to not become a pilot. <br> <br>  I feel like being a pilot has the possibility of becoming tedious. I don't feel like being a 127945474586445634 would have the same potential to become tedious. <br> <br>  I really don't know what to think here. I am doing quite well in pilot school. I am kind of an extroverted-introvert in the sense that I like being around people but question how I would do in a setting where I would be 439895748574545. I really like the peaceful nature of being up in a plane above the clouds. I don't know how I would do in a crowded project 439895748574545, or if I would like it as much as being above the clouds in an airplane. I also have absolutely zero experience 439895748574545. I really like the idea of it, but have no practical experience with it. <br> <br>  I will admit that the thought of being a 127945474586445634 sounds much more stressful than being a pilot. I have traveled much and I know that I am comfortable with hotels and being on the road. Being on the road is in my blood, and I feel like the road is where my heart is. I have actually never done the activity of 439895748574545, so I really don't if I would like being a 127945474586445634. Please don't suggest that I try 439895748574545 for a summer or anything. I am set up to get my CPL on a strict timeline, and I cannot afford to burn a summer on something unless I am really sure it would be my life career. I also have a very busy schedule and need to do everything quickly. So I can't take a summer off. <br> <br>  I feel like being a pilot has a much better career outlook in terms of pay and job stability (who spends their entire life a 127945474586445634!) I feel like being a 127945474586445634 is something people do when they are much younger than me; I am really doing well working toward my commercial license and working toward my professional goals. However, I have made it a goal in life to pick a career not based on money, stability, or societal ideals, but on what makes me happy. Also, I do connections with businesses that I can work at during the off-season if I become a 127945474586445634 as a career. My degree will get me a 60K+ a year job at one of these businesses if becoming a pilot does not work out. <br> <br>  Maybe I am seeing 439895748574545 as some magical thing that it is not because I never experienced it and just recently read a really captivating story about it. I hope someone here reads this who has done the activity of 439895748574545 and can tell me if it was more or less enjoyable than being a pilot. I really think this is the question I have to ask myself here. I know everyone is different, but I really want to see what other people would do if they were in this situation. <br> <br>  TL;DR: I really like flying though have been suddenly struck with a desire to be a 127945474586445634 as a career even though I have never done the activity of 439895748574545. Advice is appreciated.";
